# Determined: Deep Learning Training Platform

Determined is an open-source deep learning training platform that makes building
models fast and easy. Determined enables you to:

- **Train models faster** using state-of-the-art distributed training, without
  changing your model code
- **Automatically find high-quality models** with advanced hyperparameter tuning
  from the creators of Hyperband
- **Get more from your GPUs** with smart scheduling and cut cloud GPU costs by
  seamlessly using preemptible instances
- **Track and reproduce your work** with experiment tracking that works
  out-of-the-box, covering code versions, metrics, checkpoints, and
  hyperparameters

Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance deep
learning environment â€” which means you can spend your time building models
instead of managing infrastructure.

To use Determined, you can continue using popular DL frameworks such as
TensorFlow and PyTorch; you just need to update your model code to integrate
with the Determined API.

## Try out Determined Locally

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.determined.ai/latest/how-to/installation/requirements.html#install-docker) to install and set up docker.

 ```bash

# Start a Determined cluster locally.
python3.7 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/test
. ~/.virtualenvs/test/bin/activate
pip install determined
# To start a cluster with GPUs, remove `no-gpu` flag.
det deploy local cluster-up --no-gpu
# Access web UI at localhost:8080. By default, "determined" user accepts a blank password.

# Navigate to a Determined example.
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/determined-ai/determined
cd determined/examples/computer_vision/cifar10_pytorch

# Submit job to train a single model on a single node.
det experiment create const.yaml .
 ```

    [python38]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python38/

2.  Configure the build environment

    ```shell
    $ python3.8 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/determined
    $ source ~/.virtualenvs/determined/bin/actvate
    $ export PATH="$HOME/go/bin:$PATH"
    ```

3.  Build

    ```Shell
    $ make
    $ make package
    ```

    If you encounter error `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` during the build, set the following in `NODE_OPTIONS` and repeat the build. [More info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69692842/error-message-error0308010cdigital-envelope-routinesunsupported).

    ```Shell
    export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
    ```

    Build artifacts are saved in:

    - `./agent/dist`: agent binaries and installer packages
    - `./harness/dist`: `det` CLI Python wheel package
    - `./master/dist`: master binaries and installer packages
